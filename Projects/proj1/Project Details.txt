For this project, we are creating a BMIC (A body mass index calculator)

It needs to:
-Use the included formula:  (weightInPounds x 703) / (heightInInches x heightInInches)
-Input the weight and height
-Display the BMI
-Include message from Department of Health:
	BMI VALUES
	Underweight: less than 18.5
	Normal: Between 18.5 and 24.9
	Overweight: between 25 and 29.9
